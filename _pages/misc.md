* I am a part of the UM Powerlifting Team.
* I wrestled competitively (folkstyle) throughout high school and into my freshman year of college, and I still spar occasionally.
* I love writing, [here are some of my blog posts](https://www.sweumich.org/post/india-here-we-come) documenting a volunteer trip I did with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) to India in Summer '23.
* I am an avid fan of Musicals and Broadway, and managed to see 20 shows while interning at Google in NYC during the summer of '25!
