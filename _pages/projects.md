I focus on developing solutions at the intersection of Human-Robot Interaction and adaptive control, leveraging my skills in Python, C++, ROS, and machine learning frameworks. Below are details on my key independent and collaborative projects.

# 🤖 Project 1: [Short, Descriptive Title of Project]

**[Project Category]** | **[Date/Duration]** | **[Key Technologies: Python, ROS, PyTorch, etc.]**



### Summary & Goal
Briefly state the **problem** you addressed and the **goal** of the project in 1-2 sentences.

> *Example:* The goal of this project was to implement a robust, real-time path planning algorithm that minimizes human-robot collision risk in a shared workspace, addressing the "curse of dimensionality" in traditional planners.

### Contributions & Methods
Detail your personal contribution and the technical methods you used. Use bullet points for clarity.

* **[Specific Contribution 1]:** Implemented a novel A* search algorithm variant that dynamically updates heuristics based on simulated human velocity.
* **[Specific Contribution 2]:** Trained a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify human gaze intention from depth camera inputs.
* **[Specific Contribution 3]:** Packaged the entire planning solution into a ROS Noetic stack, enabling real-time deployment on a simulated TurtleBot platform.

### Outcomes
State the results of the project and what you learned.

* Achieved a 40% reduction in average collision distance compared to the baseline RRT* algorithm.
* Gained significant experience in optimizing C++ code for speed and integrating hardware libraries within the ROS framework.
