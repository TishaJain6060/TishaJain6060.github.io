# About Me
<br>
I am a dual degree student in Computer Science and Robotics with a minor in Statistics at University of Michigan, with an expected graduation of May 2026. I am interested in pursuing a PhD with long term goals of pursuing a career in academia, or research. My interests lie in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Human-Robot Collaboration and the development of trustworthy, interpretable robots that can adapt to uncertainty in real-world environments.

I am currently a Undergraudate Researcher in [Prof. Christoforos Mavrogiannis's](https://chrismavrogiannis.com/) lab, [Fluent Robotics](https://fluentrobotics.com/index) where I am working on an extended analysis of a user study on human–robot interactions in shared spaces. By examining how human impressions of robot motion (comfort, trust, and predictability) relate to different navigation strategies, we aim to inform the design of socially aware navigation systems that better support mutual adaptation between humans and robotic systems.

Previously, I worked with [Prof Leia Stirling](https://stirling.engin.umich.edu/) onimproving responsiveness of upper-limb exoskeletons for manipulation tasks such as grasping, moving, and holding objects.I designed an adaptive control framework that fused EMG and force sensing and used a k-NN classifier to better interpret users’ motor intent, enabling more responsive and user-aligned assistance.

I have also served as a Teaching Assistant for Human-Robot Systems [ROB 204](https://robotics.umich.edu/academics/courses/course-offerings/rob-204-winter-2022/) in the UM Robotics Department for 4 semesters, and previously for Robotics Mechanisms [ENGR 100](https://adue.engin.umich.edu/engr100_sections/850-robotics/) in the UM College of Engineering.

I am actively involved in outreach efforts on campus through Society of Women Engineers, Robotics Undergradaute Student Council and Engineering Honors Student Advisory Board.

I enjoy playing the piano, powerlifting and painting!
